# FlatMate

An app to help flatters organise flat life.

Users can sign up, create a flat profile and invite other users to join their flat.

The app has four main components.

## Shopping List

An editable list - items can be added (including quantities) and removed once they have been bought.

## Calendar

Hooked up to a calendar API. Key events for the flat can be added.

## Roster

A weekly list of assigned duties.

## Bills

A list of bills with a calculator function which can split bills between flatmates. Either evenly or by assigning certain amounts to specific people.

## Home

The homepage displays widget-like images of each component. The user can click on an image and be taken to that component.
If not already logged in the user will be taken to a page where they can register or signup.
